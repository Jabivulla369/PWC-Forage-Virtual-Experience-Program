In terms of PowerBI, I want to learn how to make interactive dashboards that are visually appealing and help me rapidly and effectively extract insights from large, complex datasets.  I want to improve my ability to visualise and analyse data using PowerBI, as well as learn more about automation and machine learning strategies. In order to better convey insights to customers and stakeholders, I also wish to strengthen my design thinking and digital storytelling skills.
